    today we are learning javascript basics
    1. operator:- ye ek symbol hota hai jo operation ki value batata hai fo eg:- 
                  20>12, ao isme (>) operator hai jo ye value batata hai ki 20 ki value 12 se badi hai.

    2. operands;- isme jo words hai wo operator ki vaule batate hai, for eg:- 
                  20>12, so the operands is 20,12, simply where the operaor works is called operands.

     Types of operator
     1. Arthimetic operaotor:- used for mathemetical operation(basically +- )
       (+) is called addiction.
       (-) is called subtraction
       (*) is called multiplication
       (/) is called division (quotient)
       (%) is called modulation(Remainder)      (Basically 5th class ki +,- )
        examples:- 10/2= 5
                   10%2= 0 (remainder=0)
                   6/10 = 0.6 (remainder)

      2. Relational operator:- used to compare two values jisse output true ya false aaye 
      eg:-  > (Greater than) (10 > 5);   // true kyuki shi me 10 5 se bada j
            < ( Less than) (10 < 5) false kyuki 5 is not greater than 10
            >= (Greater than or equal) 10>=10 True because this is equal or bigger than 10
             <= (Less than or equal)  
             == (equal to)
             != (not equal to) (5 != 3) not equal

        3. Logical operator:- these represnt values like
                             1. && = And              
                             2. ||= or 
                             3.  ! = not 
         
            eg=  (10>6 && 8<3 )false becase there is and ki aur 8 chota hai 3 se so thats why ye false h
                 
                 (10>6 || 8<3 ) true
                 ! (10>6 && 8<3 ) false ye ulta krr deta value
